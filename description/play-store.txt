Browse Privately
Orweb is the most private and anonymous web browser on Android for visiting any website, even if it’s normally censored, monitored, or on the hidden web.
★ ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orweb is the safest browser on Android. Period. Orweb evades tracking and censorship by bouncing your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.
★ CIRCUMVENT FIREWALLS AND RESTRICTIONS: Does your office, school, or region block certain websites? Not anymore. Orweb bypasses almost every kind of network restriction.
★ BROWSE ANONYMOUSLY: As the New York Times writes, “when a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” No technology is 100% effective, but Orweb is as close to anonymous as it’s possible to get on Android.
★ PRIVACY YOU CAN TRUST: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) says “the groundbreaking work from the Tor project helps users everywhere improve the safety of their online communications.”
